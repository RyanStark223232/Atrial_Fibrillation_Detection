# Atrial_Fibrillation_Detection
Course Project of ESTR3108

Many previous studies of AF classification with ECG generally limits the scope to 
classification between AF and normal rhythms with clean and carefully selected data. 
Therefore, the objective of this project is to train a classifier that is comparable with the 
result of 2017 PhysioNet Challenge with the dataset provided, which is professionally 
labelled into 4 categories, including AF, normal, other rhythm and noise. The winner of 
2017 PhysioNet Challenge obtained a F1 score of 0.83. Considering the scope of this 
project is limited to a course project lasted for one semester, the goal of this project is to 
train a classifier that obtains an F1 score equal to or above 0.8.
